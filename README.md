This is my personal keyboard layout I use for writing [Modern English Fuþorc Runes based on Rune Revival](<https://www.youtube.com/@LearnRunes>). It is created with [Kalamine](<https://github.com/OneDeadKey/kalamine>).

## Installation | ᛁᚾᛥᚩᛚᛖᛡᛋᚳᛟᚾ

To install the layouts, see the [relevant section at Kalamine's docs](<https://github.com/OneDeadKey/kalamine?tab=readme-ov-file#using-distributable-layouts>).


## Alternative | ᚫᛚᛏᛟᚱᚾᛟᛏᛁᚠ

If you do not wish to use this, then there is also the [Runeboard](<https://keyman.com/keyboards/runeboard>) by Rune Revival for [Keyman](<https://keyman.com/>).

## The Runes | ᚦᛟ᛫ᚱᚢᚾᛋ
